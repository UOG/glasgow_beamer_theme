The tex source can be compiled by running `make` from the home directory, while `make clean` removes auxiliary files
from the repository's root directory.

The adapted color theme is based on the
[colour palette](http://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/staff/brandguidelines/components/colourpalette/)
of the brand guidelines of Glasgow university and it can be found in
[glasgow.sty](src/tex/packages/glastow.sty).
If the filesystem structure of the current repository is not followed,
then the figures from [here](src/figures) need to be copied and the relative paths to these figures in
[glasgow.sty](src/tex/packages/glastow.sty)
need to be modified accordingly.
